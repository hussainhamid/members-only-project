# members-only-project

this project is about letting members log-in sign in to see stuff.

# database

there should be two tables in my database:

1. users: this table will contain all the users credentials, eg: fullname, email, password(hashed) membership status.

2. messages: this table will contain the message info: title, time, message. and an id which connects the two database together.
